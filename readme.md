# Sentiment Analysis Model

## Summary
This project implements a comprehensive pipeline for cleaning and processing text data, followed by training and evaluating machine learning models for sentiment analysis. It leverages Python, NLTK for natural language processing, scikit-learn for machine learning tasks, and Plotly for data visualization. Techniques used include tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and feature extraction using CountVectorizer. The pipeline ensures a robust and efficient workflow for text data analysis and sentiment classification.
